#Meeting-Room

Meeting Room is built based on Meetingwords (http://meetingwords.com) idea. This app can be used for online meeting that need notes and chat. This app is a pure experiment and exploration in using Angular-Fire (angularjs + firebase). Can be accessed via http://muzavan.github.io/meeting-room. Feel free to use (both app and code) or give any comment.

#Tools and Lib
Developed using Angular-Fire, jQuery, CKEditor(http://ckeditor.com/download), and Bootstrap.
